# PyBer Analysis with Matplotlib

## Overview
PyBer is a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion. The rideshare data is required to be analyzed from January to early May of 2019 based on different city types.

First, a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type needs to be created. Then, a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type is required. I am assigned to summarize how the data differs by city type and provide some recommendations on the data.

## Results

### Summary DataFrame by City Type

According to the statistics, urban has the largest number of drivers, rides and fares. 

Although urban has the highest total fares, the average fare per ride for suburban and rural is higher than urban. This may be because many people who live in suburban and rural choose to go to urban for working or shopping, so each ride will be longer and the average fare per ride will be higher. 

The reason that urban has the lowest average fare each time is because they can buy everything they need  in the surrounding area, and urban public transportation is more developed, most people will choose to use relatively cheap public transportation. 

Although rural has the lowest total rides, it has the highest average fare per driver. Because rural has the least number of drivers, therefore, the average fare is higher.

### Multiple-line Graph on Total Weekly Fares for Each City Type

The total weekly fare of Urban in all time periods is higher than suburban and rural. The total weekly fare of each city type was relatively low in January, and increased at the end of February. In general, the total weekly fare of each city type in the first quarter of 2019 is relatively stable.

## Recommendations
- PyBer should
